TO OVERCOME FROM THE PROBLEM OD CODE DUPLICATION WE WILL USE STRATEGY PATTERN IN THIS,
WE HAVE CREATED A DRIVE INTERFACE AND 4 CLASSES IMPLEMENTING IT AND EVERY CLASS HAS ITS OWN FUNCTIONALITY.

THEN WE HAVE VEHICLE CLASS AND 2 OTHER CLASS EXTENDING IT. IN BOTH OF THE CHILD CLASS THEY HAVE A CONSTRUCTOR IN WHICH
THEY CALL SUPER CONSTRUCTOR WITH AN OBJECT OF ANY 1 OF THE STRATEGY CLASSES WHICH HAS IMPLEMENTED DRIVE INTERFACE.

IN VEHICLE CLASS WE HAVE A CONSTRUCTOR WHICH INITIALIZES DRIVE OBJECT AND A METHOD DRIVE
WHICH CALLS THE DRIVE METHODS WITH ITS OBJECT.

IN THE MAIN CLASS WE INITIALIZE THE VEHICLE OBJECT OF ANY CHILD VEHICLE CLASS ACCORDING TO OUR NEED AND
WE CALL DRIVE OBJECT OF VEHICLE CLASS.

Use Case: Sorting algorithms, payment modes (CreditCard, PayPal), compression strategies (ZIP, RAR).
